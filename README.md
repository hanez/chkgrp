# chkgrp

chkgrp is a set of programs to verify if a user is a member of a group on a UNIX based system. This code is so simple that it describes itself very good.

More information will follow... Actually there are multiple programs with some different behavior. I will write more about this, but for now I will not.

# Why?

I am releasing this code because I like it and use it in some situations. If you have a usecase, fine! If not, fine too!...
